Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm **Aditya Jit Singh**, a _Business Intelligence Engineer & Analytics Professional_ currently working at **Liberty Mutual** in Seattle.

I have a deep passion for **data, analytics, and storytelling**, blending my expertise in **SQL, Python, and visualization tools like Power BI & Tableau** to uncover insights that drive big decisions. Whether it's optimizing business strategy or running A/B tests, I thrive on turning raw numbers into **actionable insights** (kind of like magic, but with data instead of a wand 🪄).

Beyond work, I am a **foodie on a mission**—always hunting down the best restaurants, and if there's sushi involved, I'm **already there** 🍣. My **dog, Toffee**, keeps me on my toes, ensuring my life isn't all just SQL queries and dashboards. When I’m not analyzing data or chasing Toffee around, you’ll find me **traveling, lifting at the gym, exploring new cities, and always looking for bigger and better opportunities.**

Oh, and if you ever want to talk about **business, tech, or real estate investing**, I’m your guy! 🚀
